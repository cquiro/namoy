      <h2>Are you ready for the truth?</h2>
      <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried.</p>
      <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.</p>
      <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero.</p>
      <p>And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

      <h2>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h2>
      <p><strong>Samuel: </strong>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit?</p>
      <p><strong>Leroy: </strong>It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>
      <p><strong>Jackson: </strong>But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
